## Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable form using 
cryptographically strong algorithms, ensuring only authorized users can 
access the data.
## The Importance of Encryption for Businesses
Encryption keeps information confidential and is a solid foundation for 
more complex security solutions. Businesses that use encryption are less 
prone to cyberattacks and can avoid unwanted situations like leaks of 
unencrypted data. Companies that gather their clients' personal 
information must use encryption to earn trust.
## OpenFileEncryptor

algorithms to let you quickly and easily encrypt any of your documents. 
Designed to boost performance and equipped with a user-friendly interface,
